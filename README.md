## Documentation
* Documentation and code is written in United States English for integration
  with other programs.
* The documented development environments are [Visual Studio Code][www-vs-code]
  and standalone [POSIX shell][www-man-page-sh-1p].
* 'Visual Studio Code' and 'Code - OSS' are collectively abbreviated to VS Code.
* POSIX shell commands to be run as user from the project's root directory are
  denoted by shell code blocks.
* Commands listed in VS Code sections are denoted by 'Workflow' and can be run
  via the [Command Palette][www-vs-code-cmd-palette] or with the specified
  default keyboard shortcuts.

## Supported platforms
* Linux
* Windows 7 or newer
  * Use [MinGW][www-mingw] or [Cygwin][www-cygwin] for the development
    toolchain.
* macOS Catalina (10.15) or newer
  * The development toolchain can be installed using the
    [Xcode command line tools][www-xcode-resources].
  * Required development packages for macOS can be installed using
    [Homebrew][www-homebrew].
  * Note: OpenGL was deprecated in macOS 10.14 and official support from Apple
    has been retired (see [About OpenGL for OS X][www-apple-opengl]).

## Requirements
* [OpenGL][www-opengl] >= 1.0
  * [Mesa][www-mesa] (Recommended implementation for Linux)
* [X11][www-x-org] (Linux)
* [libpng][www-libpng] (Linux, macOS)

## Building
### Requirements
* [C++17][www-open-std-wg21-standards] compiler ([Clang][www-clang] >= 5,
  [GCC][www-gcc] >= 5)
* [CMake][www-cmake] >= 3.10

### VS Code
Configuration:
* Install the recommended workspace extensions when prompted, or run the
  `Extensions: Show Recommended Extensions` command and click the
  `Install Workspace Recommended Extensions` button in the sidebar.
* Configure the workspace for CMake when prompted, or run the `CMake: Configure`
  command. Select `bullet_hell` as the build target.

Debugging is enabled in the default workflow when building using VS Code.

Workflow:
* `Tasks: Run Build Task`
  * Default shortcut: `Ctrl/Cmd+Shift+B`

Cleaning the build environment:
* `CMake: Clean` or `CMake: Clean Rebuild`

### Standalone
Configure:
* Debug
  ```shell
  mkdir -p build && \
  cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug -S. -Bbuild
  ```
* Release
  ```shell
  mkdir -p build && \
  cmake -S. -Bbuild
  ```

Build:
```shell
cmake --build build
```

The executable will be written to `build/bullet-hell` and the required resource
pack to `build/resources.dat`.

Cleaning the build environment:
```shell
rm -rf build
```

## Running from the development environment
### VS Code
Workflow:
* `CMake: Run Without Debugging`
  * Default shortcut: `Shift+F5`

### Standalone
```shell
build/bullet-hell
```

## Debugging from the development environment
### Requirements
* [GDB][www-gdb]

### VS Code
Workflow:
* `CMake: Debug`
  * Default shortcut: `Ctrl/Cmd+F5`

## Installation
See the following instructions to install or uninstall the game after
[building](#building).

Installing and uninstalling to/from a system directory requires sufficient
privileges (requires `sudo`, and commands to be prefixed with `sudo`, on
Linux/BSD/macOS).

```shell
cmake --install build
```

### Uninstall
```shell
cmake --build build --target uninstall
```

## Structure
* Source code is located in [`game/src`](game/src/). To add more source files to
  the program, modify the `bullet_hell_SOURCES` variable in
  [`game/CMakeLists.txt`](game/CMakeLists.txt).
* Resources are loaded at runtime from a resource pack. Source assets are
  located in the [`assets`](assets/) directory and are bundled by the source
  code in the [`resource_builder`](resource_builder/) directory at build time.
* C++ source files have the extension `.cc`.
* C/C++ header files have the extension `.h`.
* Headers configured by CMake at build time have the extension `.h.in`.
* Headers shared by both the game and the resource builder are located in
  the [`shared`](shared/) directory.

## Coding style
* Lines should be no longer than 80 characters, unless readability or
  functionality is significantly affected.
* Each source file should begin with a comment formatted as follows:
  ```
  <filename>

  <description>

  Copyright (c) <year> <authors>.

  SPDX-License-Identifier: <identifier>
  ```
* Code should fit the conditions specified in [`.editorconfig`](.editorconfig)
  and [`.clang-format`](.clang-format) (see the
  [ClangFormat documentation][www-clang-format] for more information).
